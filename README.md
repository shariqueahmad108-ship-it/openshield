## Project Leadership

OpenShield is led through a collaborative, maintainer-led governance model.

| Name | Role | Responsibilities |
|---|---|---|
| [Vishnu Ajith](https://github.com/Vishnu2707) | Project Lead | Project direction, final governance decisions, releases, and organization administration |
| [Muhammad Ibrahim](https://github.com/m-khan-97) | Co-Project Lead | Engineering direction, security and enterprise-readiness, contributor coordination, and project delivery |
| [Muhammad Sihan Haroon](https://github.com/H-Sihan) | Co-Project Lead | Technical leadership, contributor coordination, and project delivery |

The complete leadership and maintainer responsibilities are recorded in
[MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) and governed by [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md).

## The Problem

Enterprise cloud security tools like **Wiz**, **Prisma Cloud**, and **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** cost **$50,000–$500,000/year**.

Startups, SMEs, universities, and student teams are left with **zero visibility** into their Azure security posture. A misconfigured storage blob, an overprivileged service principal, or an open NSG rule can sit undetected for months.

**OpenShield changes that.**

## Why Post-Quantum Cryptography Matters Now

Adversaries are collecting encrypted Azure traffic today to decrypt it when quantum computers become available. This is called a Harvest Now Decrypt Later attack and it is happening right now.

OpenShield scans Azure for classical cryptographic assets that need migration before it is too late:

- TLS configurations using RSA or ECDH key exchange on App Services
- Key Vault keys using RSA or ECC algorithms vulnerable to Shor's algorithm
- Certificates using classical signature algorithms

Findings map to NIST FIPS 203 (ML-KEM), FIPS 204 (ML-DSA), and FIPS 205 (SLH-DSA) and feed directly into post-quantum migration planning.

---

## What OpenShield Does

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Misconfiguration Scanner** | Runs 144 Azure security rules across storage, network, identity, database, compute, Key Vault, AKS, Kubernetes workloads, post-quantum cryptography, backup, serverless, private endpoint, and supply chain posture |
| **Compliance Mapper** | Maps findings to CIS Benchmarks, NIST CSF, ISO 27001, and SOC 2 framework JSON files |
| **Scan History API** | Stores scans and findings in PostgreSQL and exposes findings, score, scan history, compliance posture, drift, and resource inventory over REST |
| **Remediation Playbooks** | Every documented rule ships with a matching review-gated remediation script (144 playbooks) |
| **Security Dashboard** | Full React dashboard deployed on Vercel - live monitoring, findings, compliance, drift, prioritization, and AI-layer views |
| **Project Website** | Documentation and reference site at [owasp.github.io/openshield](https://owasp.github.io/openshield/) - blog, rules gallery, architecture, evidence guides, roadmap, and releases |
| **Sentinel Integration** | Normalises findings and pushes them into Microsoft Sentinel via a Log Analytics custom table and KQL analytics rules |

## Security Assurance

OpenShield has achieved the **OpenSSF Best Practices Passing Badge**, completing 100% of the applicable Passing-level criteria across project governance, change control, reporting, quality, security, and code analysis.

<p align="center">

<p align="center">
  <strong>OpenSSF Best Practices - Passing</strong>
</p>

The project's OpenSSF status is publicly verifiable through the official OpenSSF Best Practices project record. OpenShield continues to strengthen its engineering, security assurance, and open source governance practices as it progresses through the higher-level criteria.

## Live Demo

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| **Security Dashboard** (Vercel) | `https://openshield-gules.vercel.app` |
| **REST API** (Render) | `https://openshield-api.onrender.com` |
| **Project Website** | `https://owasp.github.io/openshield/` |

> **Note:** The API is hosted on Render. The dashboard connects automatically on load and shows live data from the PostgreSQL database.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Security Requirement:** Production deployments **fail at startup** if `JWT_SECRET` is missing, set to the insecure default, or shorter than 32 characters. Generate a strong secret with:
> ```
> python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
> ```
> Set `OPENSHIELD_ENV=production` (or rely on Render's automatic `RENDER=true`) to enable this enforcement. Local development runs without these signals are allowed to use the default with a warning.

## Quick Start

**Backend (Flask API + Scanner)**

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/OWASP/openshield.git
cd openshield

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set your Azure credentials
export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=your-subscription-id
export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
export AZURE_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
export JWT_SECRET=your-strong-secret   # used to protect write endpoints (scan trigger, AI)
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://openshield:openshield@localhost:5432/openshield

# Create or update the database schema
alembic upgrade head

# Run a scan
python -c "
from scanner.engine import ScanEngine
import json, os
result = ScanEngine(os.environ['AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID']).run_scan()
print(json.dumps(result, indent=2))
"

# Start the API
FLASK_APP=api/app.py flask run
```

See [Database Migrations](docs/database-migrations.md) for schema changes and the
one-time onboarding step required for existing production databases.

**Local containers (Compose)**

```bash
# Starts PostgreSQL 16, applies migrations, then starts the API, worker, and dashboard
docker compose --profile local up --build

# Database-aware API readiness
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:8000/ready
```

The profile is intentionally named `local`: its database credentials and JWT secret are development-only values, ports bind to loopback, and the dashboard talks to `http://localhost:8000`. Set the four `AZURE_*` variables in your shell before starting Compose if you want the worker to execute real scans. Stop the stack with `docker compose --profile local down`; add `--volumes` only when you intentionally want to remove local database and frontend dependency data.

**Frontend (React dashboard)**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install

# Local dev - points at http://localhost:5000 by default
npm run dev

# To develop against the live Render backend:
VITE_API_URL=https://openshield-api.onrender.com npm run dev
```

No token is required in public demo mode. By default, API endpoints require a JWT, and POST endpoints always require one.
